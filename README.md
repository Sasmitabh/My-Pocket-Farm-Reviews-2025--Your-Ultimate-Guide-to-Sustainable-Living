## **How Does My Pocket Farm Work?**
**My Pocket Farm** operates using **aquaponics**, a sustainable farming method that combines fish and plants in a self-sustaining ecosystem. This system allows users to grow fresh, organic food using **90% less water** than traditional gardening while producing up to **ten times more food per acre**.

Here‚Äôs how it works:
1. **Fish Tank Setup**: The system includes a small fish tank where fish produce waste. This waste is rich in nutrients and acts as a natural fertilizer for plants.
2. **Water Circulation**: The nutrient-rich water is pumped from the fish tank to the plant bed, providing essential nourishment to the crops.
3. **Plant Growth**: The plants absorb these nutrients, naturally filtering the water, which is then returned clean to the fish tank. This creates a closed-loop system, requiring minimal effort and no need for soil.
4. **Daily Maintenance**: The system only needs about **five minutes of daily care**, such as feeding the fish and checking the water flow.
